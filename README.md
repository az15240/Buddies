# Buddies

This is an app that connects students around you. University students could have a lot of things to do, such as looking for a study group, inviting others to a party, or looking for a person to walk home together when itâ€™s 12am, and so on.

We first tried to use figma to draw the basic UI. Then we learned how to use flutter and tried to code the project.

It's our first time attending a hackathon and first time using figma and flutter, so the project shows up more like a draft than a real product. We want to try to finish it and maybe make it into a real app in the future.
